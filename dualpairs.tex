As we have seen in the previous chapters, there are various issues that prevent the geometric quantization programme from having sufficiently nice algebraic properties; among them, the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition prevents all symplectic manifolds from being quantizable, and the choice of polarization may be arbitrary and fail to be canonical in any sense.

To rectify this situation, Weinstein (in \cite{weinsteindualpairs}) proposed that a category of \emph{dual pairs} be used as the classical setting for quantization. In this chapter, we will present the basic definitions and constructions of the category.
