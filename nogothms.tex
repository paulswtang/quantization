We now come to a point where we are able to review the literature on what are called ``no-go'' theorems in the theory of quantization, or in other words, theorems concerning obstructions to the existence or construction of $G$-structures (for $G$ some Lie group), functors, or other algebraic properties.

A good survey on this topic is Gotay, `` '' \cite{gotay}; other sources that may be helpful are Ginzburg and Montgomery, ``Geometric Quantization and No Go Theorems'' \cite{ginzburgmontgomery},%%%%%CITE
