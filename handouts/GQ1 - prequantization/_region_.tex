\section{Examples}
%include example of why prequantization map is un-physical: particle in a box, for example
We now give three examples: a basic example of prequantization, and two examples displaying the inherent un-physicality of the prequantized Hilbert space and the prequantized operators.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{(Cotangent Bundles.)} We first consider the prequantization of a cotangent bundle $T^*Q$ where $Q$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $n$. The cotangent bundle has a natural global symplectic 2-form given by
$$
\omega = \sum_{i=1}^n \d q_i \wedge \d p_i
$$
where $(q_i,p_i)$ are \emph{canonical coordinates}; note also that $\omega = -\d\theta$ for
$$
\theta = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \d q_i,
$$
the canonical 1-form on $T^*Q$.

We note that the cohomology class $[\omega] = 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ since we have that $\omega$ is exact ($\d(-\theta) = \omega$).

Hence the cotangent bundle is prequantizable; since $\omega$ is equivalently the curvature form, we have a flat connection\footnote{See theorems 9.1 and 9.2 of Kobayashi \& Nomizu}, for example, for a proof of the claim that a connection is flat iff the bundle is trivial.} $\nabla$ and it is thus sufficient to take $T^*Q \times \mathbf{C}$ as the prequantum line bundle.

We obtain a prequantum Hilbert space of $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{C}(T^*Q)$ with metric given by (...)%%%%%%%%%%%%

The quantized operator corresponding to $f \in C^\infty(T^*Q)$ is then given by
$$
Q[f] |\psi\rangle = \nabla_{X_f}|\psi\rangle + f|\psi\rangle.
$$

\item \emph{($\mathbf{R}^3$.)} As a specific example of the above, we consider $Q = \mathbf{R}^3$. According to the above, we have the symplectic manifold $T^*\mathbf{R}^3 \equiv \mathbf{R}^6$, with the hermitian line bundle given by $\mathbf{R}^6 \times \mathbf{C}$; we note that this is unique as Euclidean space is simply connected (i.e. all loops in the fundamental group are contractible), and the associated connection $\nabla$ is given by (...)%%%%

Choose the Hamiltonian function $H$ to be (...)%%%%



\item \emph{(Harmonic Oscillator.)} In the case of the $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillator, we have the phase space/symplectic manifold $(M,\Omega)$ given by
$$
M = \{(q^j,p_j) \in \mathbf{R}^{2n}\}, \Omega = \sum_j dq^j \wedge dp_j,
$$
with the Hamiltonian $H$ given by
$$
H(q,p) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_j ((q^j)^2 + (p_j)^2).
$$
We see that Born-Sommerfeld condition is satisfied, since we have $[\Omega] = 0 \in \mathbf{Z}$, and the line bundle is trivial and unique since $M$ is simply connected, with $L = M \times \mathbf{C}$ and the associated connection $\nabla$ given by
$$
\nabla_X \psi = X \psi + (2\pi i)\omega(X)\psi = (\ldots)%%%%%%
$$
where $\omega$ is the pullback given by (...)%%%%%%

Now let us try to apply the prequantization map to the energy, i.e. $H$; we have that
$$
O_H = -i\hbar\sum_j\biggl[p_j\frac{\partial}{\partial q^j} - q^j\frac{\partial}{\partial p_j} \biggr];
$$
further, we have that
$$
O_H(\psi) = i\hbar\{H,\psi\},
$$
where the section $\psi$ is interpreted as a function $M \to \mathbf{C}$.

There's an issue here, however; the operator $O_H$ and the classical Hamiltonian $H$ have the same spectrum, and hence $O_H$ has a continuous spectrum. But we know from physical experience that quantum operators must have discretized spectra.
