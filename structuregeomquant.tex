\section{Obstructions to Geometric Quantization}
\begin{thrm}
Let \textbf{Pois} and \textbf{Hilb} be the categories of Poisson manifolds and Hilbert spaces, respectively, and let \textbf{Diff} be the category of smooth manifolds; there are natural functors $T^*$ and $\Lambda^{1/2}$ out of \textbf{Diff} to \textbf{Pois} and \textbf{Hilb} (respectively), called the \textit{cotangent bundle} and \textit{half-density} functors, given by

Then the Groenewald-van Hove theorem states that there does not exist a functor $\mathcal{Q}: \mathbf{Pois} \to \mathbf{Hilb}$ such that

In particular, this shows that deformation quantization (in the style of Kontsevich) is not functorial. %is this correct?
