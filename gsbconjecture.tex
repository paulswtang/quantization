Suppose we have a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ along with a group of symplectomorphisms $G$ acting on $M$. Intuitively, we may think of this group of symplectomorphisms as a group of \emph{symmetries} on the phase space; we can, then, perform a \emph{symplectic reduction} on the phase space with respect to $G$ the group of symmetries, in order to obtain a reduced phase space $M // G$.

The \emph{Guillemin-Sternberg-Bott} conjecture asks whether this process of taking a symplectic reduction commutes with the geometric quantization programme in the following manner:
